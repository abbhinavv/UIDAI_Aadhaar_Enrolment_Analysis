# UIDAI Aadhaar Enrolment Data Analysis

This project analyzes Aadhaar enrolment data provided by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to uncover demographic patterns, temporal trends, and operational anomalies. The goal is to translate large-scale enrolment data into explainable, decision-oriented insights rather than black-box predictions.

## Project Overview

Aadhaar enrolment is a large-scale, real-world system with heterogeneous data across regions and time. This analysis focuses on understanding how enrolment demand varies across states and districts, how it evolves over time, and where abnormal spikes or demographic patterns emerge.

The project emphasizes robust data preprocessing, careful time-series handling, and interpretable analytics suitable for administrative and operational planning.

## Key Questions Addressed

- How does Aadhaar enrolment vary across states and over time?
- Which regions show sustained growth or declining enrolment demand?
- Are there abnormal enrolment spikes indicating special drives or events?
- How does enrolment differ across age groups?
- What do child–adult enrolment ratios indicate about system maturity?

---

## Key Highlights

- Robust handling of real-world data issues such as mixed date formats and missing time periods  
- Time-series analysis of enrolment trends and growth dynamics  
- State-wise and district-wise anomaly detection using percentile-based thresholds  
- Age-group enrolment distribution and child–adult ratio analysis  
- Clear visualisations to support interpretability and decision-making  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Notes

- The analysis focuses on explainable insights rather than predictive modeling.
- The dataset is provided by UIDAI for analytical purposes.
- The notebook is structured to be readable top-to-bottom and reproducible.
